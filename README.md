# Transitioning SMM Ownership to Linuxboot

This repo contains the background of the problem, results of the research on existing implementations in coreboot and EDK2, the design of the proposed solution, and its implementation (PoC).

## Background on SMM
System Management Mode (SMM) is a special purpose mode for handling the system-wide functions, intended to be used only by system firmware, hence not accessible for the operating system or its applications. \
SMM can be only invoked through System Management Interrupt (SMI) - either through SMI# pin on the processor or through a SMI message via APIC bus. SMI is nonmaskable, that is, it cannot be disabled/ignored by the processor,
and operates independently from the processor's interrupt and exception handling. When SMI is received, the processor saves the current context in SMRAM, enters SMM and starts executing the SMI handler. Once in SMM, the processor signals
external hardware about handling SMI, the implementation of signaling is platform dependent and hence omitted here. Exiting from SMM can only be done by executing RSM instruction, available to the SMI handler. RSM
restores the previous processor's context back to the registers from the save state image from the SMRAM. Please note that the description given here is brief, for detailed description, please refer to Intel's developer manual for IA-32/64
architecture, (Volume 3C, Chapter 33) [[1]](#1). 
### SMRAM
The above mentioned SMRAM is a address space to which the processor switches when entering SMM. All memory addresses become mapped to the low 4GB's of the physical address space. The critical code and data of SMI handler 
resides in SMRAM. There is a pre-defined region within SMRAM - the State Save Area - where the per-SMI context is saved. The default size of SMRAM is 64 KB starting from the physical address called SMBASE. The SMBASE default value is 30000H, and 
the State Save Area is stored from SMBASE + FE00H to SMBASE + FFFFH. The processor looks for the SMI handler instructions at addresses starting from SMBASE + 8000H. In general, the size of SMRAM can be between 32KB and 4GB. For the details on registers
stored in State Save Area, please refer to Intel's developer manual for IA-32/64 architecture, (Volume 3C, Chapter 33.4) [[1]](#1). When running on multiprocessor systems, each processor needs its own SMRAM space, and while there can be an overlap of the memory space,
each processor needs its own State Save Area. There are no restrictions on how many processors can excute in SMM at given time.
